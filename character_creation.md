# Vampire Character Creation

## Mechanics Intro
Making a Vampire character is *easy* compared to the experience many RPGs provide, and will take you about 10-15 minutes - outside of whatever time you spend reading this.

When you choose to do something - anything *at all* that a human might do in this game - you'll add together an Ability and a Skill, and roll that many dice.  The exception is when you're doing something so easy and/or normal it automatically succeeds, like climbing stairs in no particular hurry or driving a car in normal traffic.

Attributes are 9 innate things that take talent and are difficult to learn or teach, like Agility or Intelligence.

Abilities are the opposite - 25 sets of learned facts, techniques and practices that anyone can come to understand given the time, like how to trade stocks, build a house, or make valid legal arguments.

So, when you do something, you'll be better at it on the basis of one area of talent and one area of skill, basically.  Obviously, it's best for you if you are both skilled and talented at something, but one or the other is better than neither!

EXAMPLES:

* Hack a computer user account for its password: Wits (Attribute) + Computer (Ability) (they're always put in that order)
* Punch someone's lights out: Strength + Brawl
* Impress a guy at a bar: Charisma + Subterfuge
* Drive the getaway van: Dexterity + Drive

(Note that it says 'anything a human might do' - if you're mind-controlling someone, or resisting Thirst, or other things Vampires do but people don't, that's when the non-Attribute-or-Ability stats on the character sheet come in.)  OK, on to your character!

## Attributes and Abilities
### Attributes
Everyone gets 1 point in every Attribute for free.  From there, you can buy more, up to 5 in each.  Let's go over what that would mean qualitatively:

* 1 - Deficient vs. the average
* 2 - Normal
* 3 - Talented
* 4 - World-class
* 5 - Pre-eminent in the world, maximum achievable

You get 3 attribute pools: 7, 5, and 3.  You may assign each to one of Mental, Physical, and Social.  Then, spend those pools 1:1 to buy attribute increases.

PHYSICAL	|	MENTAL		 |	SOCIAL
------------|----------------|---------------
Strength	|	Charisma	 |	Perception
Dexterity	|	Manipulation |	Intelligence
Stamina		|	Appearance	 |	Wits

### Abilities
You do *not* get points in Abilities for free.  These are things people study in classes or learn from experience, so you can have 0 in them - meaning you haven't studied at all yet.  Qualitatively:

* 1 - Amateur or Student
* 3 - Professional
* 5 - Maximum achievable

Again, 3 pools (13/9/5), 3 categories, 1 pool point for 1 skill point.  For now, no Ability can be above 3.  These category names will never matter again, by the way.

TALENTS		|	SKILLS			|KNOWLEDGES
------------|-------------------|-------------
Alertness	|	Animal Ken 		|Academics
Athletics	|	Crafts			|Computer
Brawl		|	Drive			|Finance
Dodge		|	Etiquette		|Investigation
Empathy		|	Firearms		|Law
Expression	|	Melee			|Linguistics
Intimidation|	Performance		|Medicine
Leadership	|	Security		|Occult
Streetwise	|	Stealth			|Politics
Subterfuge	|	Survival		|Science

## Backgrounds
Backgrounds are vague, but very important, advantages that represent the character's situation in the world.  You have a paltry 5 points to allocate between all of the Backgrounds, and they can each have between 1 and 5 points allocated to them.  Any without an allocation start at 0.

BACKGROUNDS
* Allies - powerful people who really want to help you, but who are very busy.  One ally (plus they all improve) per point.
* Contacts - a lot more people, but who don't want to help you as much.  A few contacts per point.
* Fame - Yeah, like Bowie.  3 points is statewide fame; 5 is international
* Generation - The more points you put in this, the closer you are to Caine and the more blood you can fit in this bad boy
* Herd - A fan club, cult, kink group, dungeon, or other set of humans from whom you can drink at low risk.  2^(points+1) people.
* Influence - Yeah, like Instagram.  2 points is state political figure; 4 is national.
* Mentor - In this case, always an elder vampire; even a *very* wise human can be a Retainer instead
* Resources - Material wealth.  Note that this is human money or goods; there's no Wizarding Bank or whatever shit
* Retainers - Loyal beings who will help you constantly if asked, like servants or lovers or even a dog.  1 point per creature.
* Status - Standing in vampire society.  More than 3 points implies a role in local government.

## Virtues
As new vampires, you still have these!  Virtues are the good things about humanity.  Since you're still vaguely human, you get 1 point for free in each virtue, and you have 7 more to distribute as you wish; Virtues have a maximum of 5.  In addition to what their names imply, raising Courage makes you more determined/motivated as well, whereas the other two make you more human and make the Thirst play a less controlling role in your life.

VIRTUES
* Conscience
* Self-Control
* Courage

## Derived stats: Willpower and Humanity
### Humanity
Humanity is just what it sounds like, and ranges between 1 and 10.  Let's look at some scores:
* 0 - you are nothing but the Thirst now, and have to make a new character
* 4 - the kind of guy who unironically says "he had it coming" after a casual murder
* 7 - the average person, even the living, breathing type
* 10 - a Catholic saint; you seek to do no harm and you'd die in pain before you'd kill

Low Humanity scores mean you're an asshole and may have trouble blending in.  Eventually, nearly every elder vampire ends up with a low score - but how long that takes is the story of your character, basically.  Your starting Humanity is equal to your Conscience plus your Self-control.

### Willpower
Willpower also ranges between 1 and 10. It is an exhaustible supply of personal determination that can be used to add 'oomph' to most any roll you attempt to make, but once you're out, you're out until you can do something that "recharges the batteries" so to speak.  Your starting maximum is equal to your Courage.

## Clan and Disciplines
You don't have to play a loyal card-carrying member, but every Vampire is part of a Clan by virtue of having a parent who also was, whether they like it or not.  Each Clan represents (putative) descent from a particular vampire of the 2nd or 3rd generation, an Antediluvian.  Vampire Clans have belief systems that matter a lot, but an individual can hew to these or not - however, no one can escape the fact that their Clan determines which Disciplines they can start with.

Disciplines are Vampiric blood magic.  Unlike magic used by wizards, there's not usually study or 'spellcasting'; vampires just innately know (or are shown by their elders) how to expend human blood to accomplish certain things.  Many of the human legends and myths surrounding vampires are actually true, *of vampires with certain Disciplines only* - turning into bats, for example. 

Disciplines are very powerful, but they all cost blood to use.  A thirsty Vampire can't use them, and even a sated one can become thirsty in a hurry through overuse.  You get 3 points to spend on Disciplines, which you can split any way you like between your chosen Clan's 3 options.  

Unlike less precious Attribute or Ability points, each point spent on a Discipline (unless I have marked it 'simple') will usually grant you a radically new and different ability rather than a proportional increase in chance of success.

NB: If you care to read the rulebook beyond this document during character creation, Clans and Disciplines are where to spend your time: they're the areas I'm doing the most summarization of.

### Disciplines
* Animalism - A special bond.  You can talk to, relate to, and eventually control animals.
* Auspex - Superhuman perception. Eagle eyes, cat ears, sixth sense, and ultimately telepathy.
* Celerity - Superhuman speed.  This is a simple one.
* Chimerstry - The Vampiric art of illusion.  Conceal things or change perceptions of them, eventually conjure illusions
* Dementation - Spontaneous insanity.  The Malkavian's ability to transfer his madness to others.
* Dominate - Mind control.  Issue a simple must-obey command, or eventually mindwipe or possess weak people
* Fortitude - Superhuman resilience.  Another simple one.
* Necromancy - You know what this is.  Seances and re-animations.
* Obfuscate - Hiding in plain sight. The ability to remain either unperceived, unremembered, or obscure on a supernatural level.
* Obtenebration - Shadow magic.  Manipulation of and control over shadows to achieve supernatural effects.
* Potence - Superhuman strength.  Simple.  You can throw cars with this.
* Presence - Vampiric swagger.  The supernatural ability to sway people - especially a crowd - towards liking you.
* Protean - Shapeshifting.  The ability to temporarily become like other beings physically, or even like inanimate things.
* Quietus - The art of assassination.  Ways to kill, use poison, be quick, or be quiet.
* Serpentis - Do as the snake does.  Hypnotize people, taste the air, have scales.  Mostly unique to Settites.
* Thaumaturgy - The truest magic Vampires can do. Not technically a Discipline.  The learned art of casting Tremere blood spells.
* Vicissitude - Flesh-carving.  The Tzimisce art of doing magic plastic surgery on oneself, enemies, or unfortunate allies.

### Clans
#### Camarilla-aligned
* Brujah - Rebels, outlaws, philosophers, punks.  Almost all want social change in some form.  Celerity, Potence, Presence.
* Gangrel - Tribal, primitivist Vampires good at rural survival.  Eventually resemble animals. Animalism, Fortitude, and Protean.
* Malkavian - Vampires descended from Malkav suffer derangements, which some call gifts.  Auspex, Dementation, Obfuscate.  
* Nosferatu - Disfigured and hideous vampires, they dwell in dark places and hear many secrets.  Animalism, Obfuscate, Potence.
* Toreador - Artists, dilettantes, and performers, these vampires crave the creativity they've lost.  Auspex, Celerity, Presence.
* Tremere - Mystics, librarians and magicians.  Upstart Clan.  Highly secretive and distrusted.  Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy.
* Ventrue - The nobility of the night.  Have a reputation for honor and picky eating.  Dominate, Fortitude, Presence.

#### Sabbat-aligned
TBD

#### Nominally neutral
TBD

## Freebies
This is where it gets good y'all.  You get 15 discretionary 'freebie' points to beef up any of the areas we've been over so far.  Since (as you may have noticed) there's no randomness in WoD character creation, this is your biggest chance to differentiate yourself from the rest of your group right here, in the allocation of these points.  They're very special; Abilities above 3, Willpower above 5, and Disciplines above 3 are only possible at creation through these points.

This is also important: *you can buy Disciplines your Clan doesn't allow for with freebies*.  NB: Most Storytellers will want an explanation of how that situation came to be.

Here are the conversion rates:
* Attribute - 5 freebies per
* Ability - 2
* Discipline - 7 
* Background - 1 (highly recommend)
* Virtue - 2 (note that this raises one of your derived stats as well, so cost for the Virtue is *arguably* 1)
* Humanity - 1
* Willpower - 1

Congratulations, you're done with mechanical stuff!  You can figure everything else out with your Storyteller before or during play.  Ask them about: concept, nature, demeanor, and starting blood pool.
